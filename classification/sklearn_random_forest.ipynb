    "## Random forest\n",
    "**It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. The idea is to build multiple trees with random subsets of the data and features, and then take a majority vote to make predictions. Random forests are widely used in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and engineering due to their high accuracy and ability to handle high-dimensional data.**"

The dataset is split in such a way that 20% of the samples are reserved for testing, and the remaining 80% are used for training. The random_state parameter is set to 42 to ensure that the same random split is obtained each time the code is run. The resulting training and testing sets are stored in the variables X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test.
